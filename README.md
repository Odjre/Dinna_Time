# Dinna'Time

Dinna’Time solves the “What’s for Dinner Tonight?” question. The application will provide a list of recipes for an ingredient you input and a list of cocktails for an alcoholic spirit you input.

## Motivation

As a hungry and thirsty person, I want to be able to make a meal and drink with the ingredients I have in my pantry in order to satisfy my hunger and quench my thirst. This application will allow the user to do just that with the simple input of an ingredient or type of alcohol they have lying around the house, aiding with meal-time indecision.

## How to Use

The design of this application is aimed at the ease of the user experience, quickly and simply being able to receive recipe choices from a single user input. No installation is needed. The user will access the application directly from their chosen browser, ready to go. An ingredient input will be required, and once input is entered and submitted, a list of recipes will be revealed including the chosen ingredient.
